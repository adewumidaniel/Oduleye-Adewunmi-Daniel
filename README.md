### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Revenue Performance.csv" file from **Ayotunde Ajibola** contained detailed information about each revenue generated by various client in some regions  of some countries 

### Tools 

- Power Query - Data Cleaning
- Power BI- Data Analysis
- Power BI - Create Report

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:

1. Loading data on Power query
2. Inspection and aligning 
3. Data cleaning and formating
4. Loading data for Analysing
5. Create new measures 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA invloved exploring the Revenue performance data to answer key question such as:

- What is the overall Revenue trend by month
- Which Country has the higest revenue
- Which region has the highest
- What is the overall revenue
- What client has the higest revenue
- What department make the most revenue by percentage
- Total Hourly worked

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting formal worked with

```
 POWER BI
- Revenue_%_Region = DIVIDE(SUM(Table1[service_time]),CALCULATE(Table1[Total Revenue],ALL(Table1[service_date]))*100)
- sum_hourly_rate = SUM(Table1[Sum of Hourly Rate])
- No of Client = DISTINCTCOUNT(Table1[client_name])
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follow:
1. Revenue was extremley low in the month of February but has a great raise in the month of March then start galloping from April till December.
2. United Kingdom is the country with higest revenue from the country of 4 why Nigeria has the lowest revenue in the year reviewed
3. From the 4368 no of clients, top 5 client with higest sales are Smith Inc, Smith Plc, smith group smith LLC and Williams and son respectively based on there revenue generation in a descending order.
4. Bottom 5 clients from 4368 clients are as follows, Bunch-Fraizier, Parker-Martin, Walters, Taylor, Dickerson, Torres-Montgo.
5. Europe has the highest revenue among the region in review 

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- More hourly work should be assigned to the 5 bottom client for more revenue generation
- Focus on training the bottom 5 client 
- Focus on creating more awareness in the month of February in the subsequent year in other to have increase in revenue.  
- Focus should be placed on Nigeria clients in other to have increase in revenue for Nigeria 

### Limitations

- I had to create new measure that will calculate sum_hourly_rate, in other to know the number of hours client worked to have the total revenue.
- Create new measure for Revenue_%_Region to understand the revenue made by each region in review
